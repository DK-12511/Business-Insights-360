🚀 Exciting Announcement 🚀
📊 Presenting My First Power BI Project: 'AtliQ Business Insights 360' 📊
I'm excited to unveil this project, which is a key highlight of my Data Analyst Bootcamp at Codebasics. It’s been an incredible journey, and I’m eager to showcase the insights and skills I’ve gained in the process.

🗺 Project Challenge:
"AtliQ Hardware, similar to many organizations across Latin America, faced significant hurdles due to reliance on outdated Excel-based analytics. In response, the company's leadership took a decisive step toward modernizing their data infrastructure by launching a comprehensive data analytics initiative."

📣 Sales Dashboard: Focuses on customer and product performance, with a detailed analysis of unit economics, and a performance matrix based on Net Sales (NS) and Gross Margin Percentage (GM%).

📣 Marketing Dashboard: Highlights regional and product performance, providing insights into unit economics and performance metrics based on Net Sales (NS) and Gross Margin (GM%).

🚚 Supply Chain Dashboard: Tracks forecast accuracy, net error, and key metrics, offering a detailed breakdown by customer and product to optimize supply chain performance.

👨‍🎓 Executive Dashboard: Delivers a strategic overview with insights into competitor market share, revenue trends by division and channel, and the top 5 customers and products, empowering leadership with data-driven decision-making.
